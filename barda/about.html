    <h1>About Barda wildlife sanctuary</h1>
<p> 
    Barda Wildlife Sanctuary is located in Gujarat, India. It is situated approximately 15 kilometres (9.3 mi) from Porbandar and 100 kilometres (62 mi) west of Gir Forest National Park. Previous to its 1979 establishment as a wildlife sanctuary, Barda was a private reserve for Porbandar and Jamnagar.[2] Approximately 4,00,000 people live in Barda.[2]
</p>
    <p>
        There are several forest sub-types, such as southern tropical forest, southern dry mixed deciduous forest and northern tropical thorn forest, while other predominant flora include Euphorbia scrub, dry deciduous scrub, and dry bamboo brakes. Important fauna are blue bull, chinkara, blackbuck, and wolf.
    </p>
        <p>
            While Barda was known to have had a population of Asiatic lions, they deserted the area towards the end of the nineteenth century. A proposed reintroduction programme by the state government was cancelled.[2]

<h2>History of barda wildlife sanctuary</h2>
<p>
    Barda Wildlife Sanctuary is located in Gujarat, India. It is situated approximately 15 kilometres (9.3 mi) from Porbandar and 100 kilometres (62 mi) west of Gir Forest National Park. Previous to its 1979 establishment as a wildlife sanctuary, Barda was a private reserve for Porbandar and Jamnagar.</p>
<p>
    Hardly 15 km from the coast of Porbandar town of Porbandar district, the hilly forest of Barda is stands against the salinity ingress in the region. This area was declared as sanctuary in February '1979.

<p>
    The area falls into two erstwhile princely states of history i.e. Rana Barda, where Ranas of Porbandar ruled once upon a time and Jam Barda, where the rule of Jamsaheb of Jamnagar prevailed. The ethnic races such as Maldharis, Bharvads, Rabaris and Gadhvis live in this region of Saurashtra.    </p>
<p>
    Sambar, chital and chinkara were present in the Sanctuary in the recent past and therefore they can be re-introduced, as the habitat is quite suitable for these wild ungulates. This would create a good prey-base for a big carnivore like a leopard. The soil and moisture conservation works can improve the water regime in the area and will have a positive effect on the vegetation and the habitat and therefore more such works should be prescribed.</p>
